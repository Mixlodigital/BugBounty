Programming Basics

    HTML: HTML is very easy to learn and there are a ton of free resources for it. If you are interested in learning about XSS this should be your first step. If you prefer an interactive tool to learn about JavaScript, I highly recommend Codecademy or W3Schools!
    JavaScript: Once you have familiarized yourself with HTML, you should understand JavaScript since you will be using it to exploit XSS vulnerabilities. The usage of JavaScript isn’t just limited to when you are exploring XSS, so it’s a very handy programming language to know. If you prefer an interactive tool to learn about JavaScript, I highly recommend CodeCademy!
    SQL: You may have guessed It already, but you won’t be able to exploit complex SQL injection vulnerabilities before having any SQL knowledge. As always, if you prefer an interactive course, feel free to use CodeCademy! https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql http://www.sqlcourse.com/
